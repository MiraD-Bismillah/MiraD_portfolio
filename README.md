Analytics Portfolio - Airlines Delay Cause

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the causes of airline delays, aiming to understand the primary factors contributing to delays. By identifying these factors, airlines and airports can make informed decisions to improve punctuality and passenger satisfaction.

## Dataset
- **Source**: kaggle
- **Description**: Contains data on flights, including delay duration, causes, and other relevant details.
- **Data Fields**:
  - Flight Date, Airline, Flight Number, Origin, Destination, Delay Cause, etc.

## Objective
The main goals of this analysis are:
1. To identify common causes of airline delays.
2. To analyze delay patterns by month, airline, airport, and time of day.
3. To provide insights to help reduce delays.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning
1. Handling missing values.
2. Removing outliers.
3. Creating new features, such as delay categories.
4. Converting categorical data for easier analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Frequency of delay causes.
2. Monthly delay trends.
3. Delay analysis by airline and airport.
4. Correlation analysis between causes and delay duration.

## Key Findings
1. Most common delay causes.
2. Seasonal delay patterns.
3. Delay variations among airlines and airports.
4. Time of day impact on delays.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Data analysis and cleaning.
- **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data manipulation and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis.
- **Tableau**: Visualization dashboard.
